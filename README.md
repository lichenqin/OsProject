TianCiOS: run as a server(lol)

## Just a Joke!

I heared a lot about harmonyOs but i didn't see the source code.

Talk is cheap. Talk is not cheap.

Because when you keep talking and do nothing then we won't trust you anymore.

So i started this project just for satire. And the name of TianCi is derived from a answear in Zhihu. And this answear is all about satire.

## Not a Joke.

Actually i will finish this project for one simple reason: people should be responsible for what they said in public, especially a big company.

I want to let the PC to be a server which interactions with other devices easily.

That means a brand new network, brand new Operating System, and something i can't imagine now.

So i will get started first by reading books like "Operating System: Design and Implementation".

## Goal

To actually implementate a OS in three years.

System calls, shell, compiler, network stack, device drives, etc.

No more talk, let's do some work.
